# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luna! 
I like computers and programming, retro stuff, hoardering old programs to my Virutal Box Machine. Old minded but don't like new trends. Iâ€™m interested in retro stuff like old Windows OSes like XP and 2K, programs like old 3D programs etc and most of all making small but stupid programs.

### ðŸ’€ðŸ‘Œ What You Do?
When great idea comes to my mind, I start to do something. Like I was in bot making stuff on Github with a friend. Sometimes I stay busy with games, reading books or doing home stuff. I don't have social media active. I hope so, I'll do here to release some programs I made.

### âš¡ Fun fact about me!!!âš¡
- I was born in January 1 1999, kinda it used for "faking age" for minors but I see my birthday as special like a code, 0101011111001111
- I like Python than C#, I was learned C# at first but I saw it as "bad way to start programming" in some way.
- I support AI but not in "creative way", they can be used as helpers or creating something different. No, they cannot be like Skynet or Shordan or HAL 9000. You already got life like Cyberpunk, where big corpos ðŸ¦†duckingðŸ¦† you.
