# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luna! 
I like computers and programming, retro stuff, hoardering old programs to my Virutal Box Machine. Old minded but don't like new trends. Iâ€™m interested in retro stuff like old Windows OSes like XP and 2K, programs like old 3D programs etc and most of all making small but stupid programs.

### ðŸ’€ðŸ‘Œ What You Do?
When great idea comes to my mind, I start to do something. Sometimes I stay busy with games, reading books or doing home stuff. I don't have social media active. I hope so, I'll do here to release some programs I made.
