ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luna, Graphic Designer and Web Programmer/Designer. I like computers and programming, retro stuff, hoardering old programs to my Virutal Box Machine. Old minded but don't like new trends. Iâ€™m interested in retro stuff like old Windows OSes like XP and 2K, programs like old 3D programs etc and most of all making small but stupid programs.



âš¡ Fun fact about me!!!
I was born in January 1 1999, kinda it used for "faking age" for minors but I see my birthday as special like a code, 0101011111001111
I like Python then C#, I was learned C# at first but I saw it as "bad way to start programming" in some way.
My designs made on 3 programs; if it's modern design like metro or flat, I use Affinity Photo (I replaced this program as Photoshop). If it is retro like abstract, 90s style, I use Paint Shop Pro 7 (with plugins) and Photoshop CS2 (I got those from Internet Archive)
